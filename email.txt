Hey Grant, 

We just heard back from Ian, apologies for the delay.  He thought the
call went well and has asked us to pass on that information he
mentioned.  Once we have this sent back he’ll schedule an on-site!
 
Attached is a “programming test” and here are the instructions:
 
Please write a simple application which turns an RSS feed into a
Pinterest-style flowing three-column display.  Each entry should
contain the picture from each feed item along with some of the
text. Use any CSS/JS framework you like.
 
Implementation must include the following:
* OOP
* Separate view and page controller
* HTML5 and CSS
* Safe output handling
 
Bonus points for:

* Image extracted from description and displayed discretely

* Successful implementation of left-to-right flow that appends newest
  entries to the shortest column

* Delivery via Github or Bitbucket
 
Here are some good source feeds:
http://www.woot.com/blog/feed.rss
http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml
http://betanews.com/feed/
 
Let me know if you have any questions!  Per Ian this shouldn’t take
too long, maybe an hour +/-.
 
Thanks!
