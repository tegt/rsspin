# RSS display - Pinterest layout

There is a working demo running on
[tegt.com](http://rsspin.tegt.com). Have fun.

### This repository responds to a coding challenge:
 
Please write a simple application which turns an RSS feed into a
Pinterest-style flowing three-column display.  Each entry should
contain the picture from each feed item along with some of the
text. Use any CSS/JS framework you like.
 
Implementation must include the following:
* OOP
* Separate view and page controller
* HTML5 and CSS
* Safe output handling
 
Bonus points for:

* Image extracted from description and displayed discretely
* Successful implementation of left-to-right flow that appends newest entries to the shortest column
* Delivery via Github or Bitbucket
 
Here are some good source feeds:
